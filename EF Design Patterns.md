#EntityFramework 

==Singleton==
Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it

==Service locator==
Make a service available globally  and decouple the calling class from the department object

==Dependency injection==
no client code has to be changed simply because an object it depends on needs to be changed to a different one 

==Command==
Encapsulate a request as an object, allowing delayed execution, undo and replay

==Repository==
Separates the data  access logic and maps it to the entities in the business logic
